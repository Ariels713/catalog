> Specimens are the core of Catalog: they help you present your content.

### Basic usage

Specimens are defined as Markdown code blocks with an argument string.

```code
'''html|dark,run-script
Content goes here...
'''
```

The format of the code block argument string is as follows: `specimen-type|option1,option2`. 
_Note that no spaces are allowed._

The first part – the one before the `|`-character – is the specimen __type__. The available types are described below. The second part after the `|` is a list of comma-separated __options__ for the specimen. This second part is optional, so both of the following are valid argument strings: `html` and `html|dark`.

### Documentation conventions

The documentation displays options in a list, using the following pattern:

- __`argument: type`__ Argument is the name, and type defines the expected type.
- __`src: string`__ Bold arguments/keys indicate that they are required to be defined
- `loop: boolean` while regular ones are always optional.



### These specimen are available to use out of the box:


## HTML

The HTML specimen can be used to display and run scripts. For an overview of all available options, see the [HTML specimen documentation page](/#/html).

Note that this is also the default specimen if no argument string is specified.

```html|no-source
hello world
```


## Button

```button|span-2
    {"url":"/#/button", "title":"Go to button documentation"}
```

## Code

The code specimen is intended to display source code, either as block or collapsed drawer.
See the [documentation](/#/code) to learn about the options.

```code
'''code
let {foo, bar} = baz;
'''
```


## Color

The color specimen can be used to document colors ranging from a single swatch to more complex palettes and palette columns. All options are described [here](/#/color).

```color|palette-horizontal
[   
    {"value": "#e3f1fc"},
    {"value": "#c2d8ea"},
    {"value": "#a1c0d8"},
    {"value": "#80a8c6"}
]
```


## Project

This specimen allows the documentation of cohering documents and offers the possibility to offer the files in one .zip file.
To learn more, take a look at the [documentation](#/project) which covers different use cases.

If you only need to display a single HTML document or make a file available for download, keep in mind that there are also the [html](#/html) and [download](#/download) specimen which cover these cases with less overhead.
